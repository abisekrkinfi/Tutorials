# Tutorials
This repository consists of files that I have used to practice, as I went through the tutorials!!

It contains most examples I tried (I might have well missed a few).

Neverthelesss, This is a good place to come and visit if a snapshot of what I did in the initial days of my intern is required.

A side note : There were quite a lot of exercises which I directly ran on the w3schools text editor, so this isn't all!!
